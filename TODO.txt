Add to level configs
- Number of fruits needed
- background color


Todos:

1. Create a "Stage passed" and "Game Over" screen in the game
    - Decide how many fruits (or seconds) are needed to clear in GameConfig
    - Include number of fruits cleared (this.points)
    - Make banners for the non-changing text
    - The changing text may be awkward - Andrew can handle this


2. Get a way to transition between stages
    - In SceneManager, pass "this" into the games.
    = Have a method "switch scenes" or something that takes in an arg as input
    - One approach would be have some ENUMS for stages or the "intro screen" or
      "end" screen, and then pass in a "onLoss" and "onWin" enum into each game
